## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript


### What I learned

The most challenging part of this project was implementing the form validation. I am very new to javascript and it took lots of research and trial and error to make it work the way I wanted it to. It was a great learning experience, doing the research on what I needed to solve the problem and implementing it.
